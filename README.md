# ⚡ EV Adoption Forecasting using Machine Learning

### 🔮 Predicting the Future of Electric Vehicle (EV) Growth in Washington State

This project focuses on forecasting **Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends** for counties in Washington State using **Machine Learning**. It combines **data analysis**, **time-series modeling**, and an **interactive Streamlit web app** to help policymakers, manufacturers, and researchers visualize how EV adoption is expected to grow over the next three years.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

As the world transitions toward cleaner mobility, forecasting future **EV adoption** is vital for **policy planning**, **infrastructure development**, and **resource allocation**.
However, accurately predicting EV growth at a regional level is challenging due to complex adoption patterns and varying local factors.

This project aims to build a **Machine Learning-based forecasting tool** that predicts **future EV adoption trends** using historical EV registration data.
The system helps identify counties with faster adoption growth, assisting stakeholders in making data-driven decisions for sustainable planning.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze historical EV adoption data for each county in Washington State.
* Build a predictive model to forecast EV adoption over the next 3 years.
* Deploy the model in an interactive **Streamlit web app** for visualization.
* Allow users to compare EV adoption trends across multiple counties.
* Provide insights into growth rates and regional EV trends.

---

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Forecast EV adoption for any selected county.
✅ Visualize **historical vs. forecasted** adoption trends.
✅ Compare up to **three counties** simultaneously.
✅ Display projected growth percentage over 3 years.
✅ Interactive and user-friendly **Streamlit dashboard**.

## 📊 Example Output

* **Line charts** comparing historical and forecasted EV growth
* **Percentage growth indicators** for each county
* **Comparison graphs** across selected counties

---

## 🧩 Insights

* EV adoption is projected to **increase significantly** over the next 3 years.
* Some counties show higher acceleration in adoption due to early infrastructure growth.
* The model provides valuable guidance for **charging station planning** and **energy demand estimation**.

---

## 🧱 Future Enhancements

* Add live data updates using APIs from government EV databases.
* Integrate Deep Learning models for improved forecasting accuracy.
* Include environmental or economic factors (like incentives, fuel prices).
* Extend the tool to other states or countries.
